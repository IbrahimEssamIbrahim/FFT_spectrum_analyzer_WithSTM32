Project Summary: Sound Frequency Analysis with FFT and LCD Display

In this project, I implemented the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm to analyze frequencies in a sound sample and display them on a 2x16 LCD screen. The main goal was to understand how the FFT algorithm and 2x16 LCDs work. To deepen my comprehension, I wrote the LCD library myself, which provided insights into the functionality of such displays.

For more details on the process, you can refer to this video by Mitch Davis: [Programing an LCD display without a microcontroller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXpeTxC3_A4&ab_channel=MitchDavis).
